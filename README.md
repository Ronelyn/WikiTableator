# WikiTableator
A tool written in Excel VBA for creating or editing MediaWiki tables quickly and easily.

If you've ever had to add or remove columns in a MediaWiki table, you know it can be a bit frustrating. If only
you could edit your tables in Excel, right? Well, now you can. 

-Copy your existing table from MediaWiki and paste it into the WikiTableator workbook.
-Make your changes. 
-Run the WikiTableator. 
-Paste the updated table text back into your wiki, replacing the existing table. 

You can also use the tool to create new tables and export them. 
Note: A current limitation prevents the tool from working on data that's not in the tool's own workbook.
